### c. CODE OF CONDUCT File (Optional)

The Code of Conduct we use is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### a. Can I include third party logos?
Generally not.  Unless we received express consent from a third party to use their logo or any other trademarks, we should refrain from doing so in our open source projects.

### b. Can I include screenshots of Splunk IP or products (e.g., UI or logos/trademarks)
Generally not.  Including screenshots of our products affects our ability to file design patents and dilutes the value of our tradedress.
