Also included at the bottom are a few FAQs on what you may or may not include in your Splunk-owned repo.

### a. NOTICE File (Required when a project redistributes 3P dependencies)

Apache 2.0 requires projects to provide copyright attribution for direct dependencies in a NOTICE file.  Generally, the attributions must include the dependency name, version number, license type, and project URL (if available). Click [here](https://infra.apache.org/licensing-howto.html)
for more information.

This sample repo provides two preferred styles for providing attribution:  (a) [text format](https://github.com/mbunda-splunk/SAMPLE-OSS-Repo-Apache2.0-with-HTML-CLA/blob/main/NOTICE_Option1) or (b) [table/csv format](https://github.com/mbunda-splunk/SAMPLE-OSS-Repo-Apache2.0-with-HTML-CLA/blob/main/NOTICE_Option2.csv) â€“ the choice is yours.

### b. README File (Required)

Please include the Splunk copyright notice at the bottom of your project's README file.  Click [here](https://github.com/mbunda-splunk/SAMPLE-OSS-Repo-Apache2.0-with-HTML-CLA/blob/main/Sample_README.md) for an illustration. 

### c. Code of Conduct File (Optional)

The Code of Conduct we use is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.  We suggest that you include this text in your project to ensure that our engagements with the community remain safe and professional.

### d. Contributing File (Required in order to accept 3P contributions)

#### Two Options: (a) Splunk HTML CLA or (b) Splunk CLA Assistant

If you anticipate accepting contributions from the open-source community you must include either the [Splunk's HTML CLA](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/form/contributions.html) or the [Splunk CLA Agreement Tracker](https://github.com/splunk/cla-agreement) in your repo.  For the HTML CLA, see the [CONTRIBUTING File](https://github.com/mbunda-splunk/SAMPLE-OSS-Repo-Apache2.0-with-HTML-CLA/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING_Sample1.md) 

# Frequently Asked Questions

### a. Can I include third party logos?
Generally not.  Unless we received express consent from a third party to use their logo or any other trademarks, we should refrain from doing so in our open source projects.

### b. Can I include screenshots of Splunk IP or products (e.g., UI or logos/trademarks)
Generally not.  Including screenshots of our products affects our ability to file design patents and dilutes the value of our tradedress.
