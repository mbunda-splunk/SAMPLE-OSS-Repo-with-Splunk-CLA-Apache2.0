# [Instructions for how to use the following guidelines]

### These instructions apply only to open source projects licensed under Apache 2.0.

These guidelines illustrate how to comply with the various Apache 2.0 license requirements.  
They explain when to add (a) a NOTICE file, 
(b) Splunk's copyright notice in a README file, (c) a CODE OF CONDUCT file, and (d) a CONTRIBUTING file.

Also included at the bottom of this file are a few FAQs on how to best safeguard Splunk's IP.

### a. NOTICE File (Required when a project redistributes any 3P code)

Apache 2.0 requires projects to provide copyright attribution for redistributed dependencies in a NOTICE file.  Generally, the attributions must include the project's name, version number, license type, and project URL (if available). Click [here](https://infra.apache.org/licensing-howto.html)
for more information.

#### Two Options:  (a) [Text Format](https://github.com/mbunda-splunk/SAMPLE-OSS-Repo-Apache2.0-with-HTML-CLA/blob/main/NOTICE_Option1) or [Table/CSV Format](https://github.com/mbunda-splunk/SAMPLE-OSS-Repo-Apache2.0-with-HTML-CLA/blob/main/NOTICE_Option2.csv)

This sample repo provides two preferred styles for providing attribution:  (a) [Text Format](https://github.com/mbunda-splunk/SAMPLE-OSS-Repo-Apache2.0-with-HTML-CLA/blob/main/NOTICE_Option1) or (b) [Table/CSV Format](https://github.com/mbunda-splunk/SAMPLE-OSS-Repo-Apache2.0-with-HTML-CLA/blob/main/NOTICE_Option2.csv) – the choice is yours.

### b. README File (Required)

Please include the Splunk copyright notice at the bottom of your project's README file – this is to ensure it is prominently displayed.  Click [here](https://github.com/mbunda-splunk/SAMPLE-OSS-Repo-Apache2.0-with-HTML-CLA/blob/main/Sample_README.md) for an example. 

### c. CODE OF CONDUCT File (Optional)

The Code of Conduct we use is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.  We suggest that you include this text in your project to ensure that our engagements with the community remain safe, productive and professional.

### d. CONTRIBUTING File (Required in order to accept 3P contributions)

#### Two Options: (a) Splunk HTML CLA or (b) Splunk CLA Assistant – the choice is yours!

If you anticipate accepting contributions from the open-source community you must include either the [Splunk's HTML CLA](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/form/contributions.html) or the [Splunk CLA Agreement Tracker](https://github.com/splunk/cla-agreement) in your repo.  For the HTML CLA, see the [CONTRIBUTING File](https://github.com/mbunda-splunk/SAMPLE-OSS-Repo-Apache2.0-with-HTML-CLA/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING_Sample1.md) 

# Frequently Asked Questions

###  a.  Can I use third-party IP – logos and images?
Generally not. This creates IP issues for us down the road. We want to mitigate any 3P claims against Splunk. Unless we have express permission to commercially exploit a 3P’s logo and trademarks, we cannot use them.    

### b.  Can I add Splunk trademarks/patented IP (e.g., UI or logos/trademarks) and confidential information to my project 
Generally not.  Including screenshots of our products affects our ability to file design patents and dilutes the value of our tradedress.  When in doubt, check with your Splunk Legal partner.
